`room.js` provides a simple way to create Jackbox style multiplayer using the peer.js library.

The `Host` object creates a room and allows the `Guest` object to connect to it via a 6 digit code. The constructors take callback functions for relevant processes.

Programs interact with these objects through the `Send` functions.

`index.html` and `main.js` show a very simple example of hwo to use these objects.
